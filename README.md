# Paket? Attack it!
A chrome extension that allows Paket into the Nuget Gallery..unofficially.

A bit of fun I'm having with [the "infamous" PR on the Nuget Gallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/4437) that attempted to add Paket as a command tab.

## How did this come about?
I'd been looking for an excuse to build a basic Chrome extension. I saw the PR and thought, "hmmm...."

As for how the original PR issue came about, maybe by the time this is published they'll have figured that out. :)

## Are PRs accepted?
YUP.

## Are you just trying to be a jerk?
I'm really not, I promise. If this isn't received kindly I'll just take it down. It was an excuse to explore Chrome extensions.
